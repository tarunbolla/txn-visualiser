This project is a React + Vite TypeScript migration of a D3.js transaction visualizer. Please generate React components, use hooks for state, and integrate D3 for SVG chart rendering. All interactivity (filters, context menus, flagging, pagination) should be implemented using idiomatic React patterns.
